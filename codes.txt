This publication is available through the ALSA Web site
(www.alsa.mil); through the Army at Army Knowledge Online (AKO)
(www.us.army.mil) and at the General Dennis J. Reimer Training and

PREFACE
1. Purpose
This publication will ease coordination and improve understanding during
multi-Service operations. A brevity code is “a code which provides no security
but which has as its sole purpose the shortening of messages rather than the
concealment of their content” (Joint Publication 1-02).

2. Scope
This publication standardizes air-to-air, air-to-surface, surface-to-air, and
surface-to-surface brevity codes. The scope is limited to those [voice] brevity
codes used in multi-Service operations and does not include words unique to
single-Service operations. While not authoritative in nature, all Services agree to
these brevity code meanings. The brevity codes have been forwarded for
inclusion or modification of current North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
joint brevity words and Allied Communications Publications of Canada-New
Zealand-United Kingdom-Australia-United States agreements.

3. Applicability
This publication is intended for air and surface operations personnel at the
tactical level.

4. Implementation Plan
Participating Service command offices of primary responsibility (OPRs) will
review this publication, validate the information and, where appropriate,
reference and incorporate it in Service manuals, regulations, and curricula as
follows:

procedures contained herein into the United States (US) Army Doctrine and
Training Literature Program as directed by the Commander, US Army Training
